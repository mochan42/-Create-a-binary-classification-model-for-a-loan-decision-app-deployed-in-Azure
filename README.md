# Create-a-binary-classification-model-for-a-loan-decision-app-deployed-in-Azure

This project consists in :<br>
* Creating a binary classfication model to predict if a client can get a loan or not to buy a house/apartment.<br>
* Deploying the classification model in the cloud via an API.<br>
* Creating a Web application deployed in the cloud so that it can be easy to get the output of the classification model for a none-technical person by clicking on the `Predict` box. The input data are fed via a drop down menu by selecting the index of the client.<br>
* By clicking on the `Explain the prediction` button, the user can explain to the client the features that explains the decision using a waterfall SHAP plot.<br>
* Finally, by clicking on the `Compare with other customers` button, the user can illustrate to the client where the client position is compared to other clients based on a number of features, such as income, credit amount etc.<br><br>
